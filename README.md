# FlappyBirdJS
Making flappy bird with javascript using Draw() to draw images on a HTML canvas. This helped me learn what a HTML canvas is, and how to draw on them using JS.

Working version can be found at http://www.callumhayden.com/flappybird/.

Thanks to www.reddit.com/r/web_programming/ for helping me fix the timeing out issue.
