# FlappyBirdJS
Making flappy bird with javascript using Draw() to draw images on a HTML canvas. This helped me learn what a HTML canvas is, and how to draw on them using JS.

Can be found at callumhayden.com/flappybird/ but sometimes lags on my website where as it works fine on my local server.
This is an issue still to fix.
